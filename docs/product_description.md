# Product Name: The Luck Circle (Anti-Networking for Entrepreneurs)

## Vision
To kill the "Elevator Pitch" and replace it with "The Scary Reach Out." The Luck Circle is a white-label matching platform that turns stagnant business communities into high-vibe connection engines.

## The Core Concept
Traditional networking is transactional, repetitive, and anxiety-inducing. "The Luck Circle" uses AI to synthesize member data (LinkedIn, Resumes, Statements) and facilitates 45-minute, 3-person (Triad) video sessions. 

## Key Differentiators
- **Triad Stability:** Three people reduce the pressure of 1-on-1 "business dates" and eliminate "dead air."
- **AI-Led Synthesis:** Participants don't introduce themselves; the AI introduces them by highlighting their shared challenges and complementary strengths.
- **The Anti-Pitch:** The AI actively moderates to prevent sales pitches, steering the conversation toward vulnerability and "Giver" behaviors.
- **Portable/White-Label:** Designed to live as a subdomain for existing Chambers of Commerce, BNI groups, and alumni networks.
